# PuzzleGame
my Advanced Programming project - a Puzzle Game built with SDL and C++.

## Window Install

- First, install [`Mingw-w64`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/), my version is `GCC-7.3.0 i686-posix-sjlj`.
- Second, download [`SDL2`](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/mingw/index.php), [`SDL2_mixer`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases), [`SDL2_image`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases/tag/release-2.6.3), [`SDL2_ttf`](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases/tag/release-2.20.2). Put all this stuff to a folder named `SDL2-dev`. Or else, just download [my installed library](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nbja5W2XzALFDwNW9Le9KWG8nCsnyxcN/view?usp=sharing). Set it to `C:\SDL2-dev`.
- Third, install [`GNU MAKE`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57042516/21271990).
- Fourth, clone this repo. Change directory to `src` folder. Open `cmd` and type `make`. It will compile into a program named `PuzzleGame.exe`.
- Now enjoy the game..!üòçüòéüòé
